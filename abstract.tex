In this paper, we benchmark three important inter processor communication (IPC) mechanisms, namely pipes, sockets and bounded buffer shared memory. We measure and compare the performance of these mechanisms for varying input buffer sizes, starting with 4k and increasing up to 512k bytes. We are interested in understanding the scalability and suitability of these mechanisms for different input parameters. In order to do this, we design experiments and evaluate timing tools that can help us measure latency and throughput for each of the above mentioned mechanisms.
